# Rich Context HTML Editor - Idea
This repository is a place to discuss, design, and document ideas for a non-traditional HTML editor that prioritizes the structure and context of the HTML content being created (rather than its display).

## Wiki

While this repo may accumulate some code samples, most of the ideas being explored will live in the documentation. The wiki will be the primary location for this documentation.
